How to build drildump:
======================

  Under Unix: type 'make'. 
  Under DOS:  DRILDUMP.EXE was compiled with Pacific C; the command used 
  was PACC -Lf -Bl -D__MSDOS__ DRILDUMP.C

  Other platforms: Up to you.

How to use drildump:
====================

  If drildump is run with no arguments, it will try to list out the objects
in the file "driller.sna" in the current directory.
  If "driller.sna" is somewhere else, you can pass its path to drildump 
thus: "drildump /path/to/driller.sna".

  Standard drildump output is an ASCII dump. However, it can also be used
to produce output in POV-Ray format. Due to my inexperience with POV-Ray the
pictures aren't anything special, but there you go.
  To select POV output, use the option "-pov". This will produce a POV file
of the first room (Amethyst). To produce a POV model of another room, add
a "-room" option, eg "drildump -pov -room 5".

  If you're running under Unix and have POV-Ray installed, you can type
"make pictures" to produce pictures of all the locations in the game, in 
PNG format.

  Note that POV output displays *all* objects, whether visible or not. This
means that (for example) in Obsidian, the slab that's used as a bridge 
appears in both its "up" and "down" positions.

Dark Side / Total Eclipse
=========================

DRILDUMP includes basic support for these Freescape games. The database 
format is almost identical (in Dark Side, the gas rig coordinates are
used to extend the room name; in Total Eclipse, the room name is shortened
to 4 characters).

To dump Dark Side or Total Eclipse, add "-dark" or "-eclipse" to the end
of the command line. "make pictures" will also generate pictures from 
Dark Side, but not Total Eclipse.
